#
# Fly.io deployment configuration for the app.
#
# Responsibilities:
# - Configures app name, region, build, and HTTP service for Fly.io hosting.
# - Sets internal port, HTTPS enforcement, machine scaling, and VM resources.
#
# Constraints & Edge Cases:
# - Must match Dockerfile and server port (5000) for correct routing.
# - All secrets and env vars must be set via Fly.io secrets, not in this file.
# - Update memory/CPU as needed for production load.
