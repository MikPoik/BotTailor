#
# Multi-stage Dockerfile for building and running the production app image.
#
# Responsibilities:
# - Builds the Node.js app with all dependencies and production assets.
# - Uses a throw-away build stage to reduce final image size.
# - Sets up environment variables and exposes port 5000 for Fly.io or other hosts.
#
# Constraints & Edge Cases:
# - NODE_ENV, VITE_*, and other env vars must be set for correct build/runtime.
# - Do not store secrets in the image; use provider secret stores for production keys.
# - Build artifacts must match Vite and server build outputs expected by the entrypoint.
